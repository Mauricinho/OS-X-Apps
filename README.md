## [Hazel Image Rules](http://rocketink.net/2013/02/screenshots-and-image-manipulation.html)

A basic set of rules to…

- align images horizontally/vertically
- resize images
- resize and align images horizontally/vertically
- and optimize PNG images (lossless and lossy)

Read to blog post to see what dependencies come with this setup or download it and tweak the rules until the work for you.

This setup relies heavily on [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) but for most things you can also use Automator as an alternative.

Teaser → the best part is the lossy compression of PNG images - it's shrinktastic:

1. Run **ImageMagick** "mogrify" to resize larger images.
2. Run **pngquant** for lossy compression.
3. Run **pngcrush**, **pngout**, **optipng** and **advpng** to mimik ImageOptim image compressing behavior.

## [OmniOutliner Templates](http://rocketink.net/2013/01/omnioutliner-templates.html)

### Sample Files From The iPad Version

If you want to download the unmodified versions, you can get download them here directly from the Omni Group:  <http://people.omnigroup.com/dmo/oosamplefiles.html>

I just prepared them for the OS X version of OmniOutliner and added all the different styles styles so that you can start right away typing.

***Styles include:***

* Spending
* Solarized (Light)
* Solarized (Dark)
* Notetaking
* Level Styles
* Classic
* Books

### Default (OO3)

This is a backup of all styles that ship with OmniOutliner3. It saved them here just in case they get replaced by something new when OmniOutliner 4 ships.

### Personal

Here are my templates… at the moment it's just one file which I use to take my study notes. I doubt that my other templates would be of any use to anyone else.

The template is called notes and looks like this:

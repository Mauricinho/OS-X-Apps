## OmniOutliner Templates

### Sample Files From The iPad Version

If you want to download the unmodified versions, you can get download them here directly from the Omni Group:  <http://people.omnigroup.com/dmo/oosamplefiles.html>

I just prepared them for the OS X version of OmniOutliner and added all the different styles styles so that you can start right away typing.

***Styles include:***

* Spending
* Solarized (Light)
* Solarized (Dark)
* Notetaking
* Level Styles
* Classic
* Books

### Default (OO3)

This is a backup of all styles that ship with OmniOutliner3. It saved them here just in case they get replaced by something new when OmniOutliner 4 ships.

### Personal

Here are my templates… at the moment it's just one file which I use to take my study notes. I doubt that my other templates would be of any use to anyone else.

The template is called notes and looks like this:
